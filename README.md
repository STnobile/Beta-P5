# Errors

all the website work fine.

I would like to point that I am getting some warning on my console.

I had a session with the mentor the 27/09 and he suggested me to ask help to the tutor so i have done that too.

Once the tutor took a look he sent me some screenshot where it didnâ€™t have the warning.
